<p id="datasets_description">
Datasets are multiple sequence alignments in fasta format.
Each dataset contains sequences of a particular virus (HBV, HIB, HCV, LSDV, norovirus).
Among the other sequences there is a recombinant virus and its major and minor parents in these alignments (except for 
the file hbv_C_Bj_Ba.fasta, it contains only recombinant and its parents). 
Minor parents have 'min' ending in their sequence name. Major parents have 'maj' ending.
Recombinant sequences are designated with 'rec' ending.
All the recombinant viruses included into the datasets are described in the articles (see references below)
